# FAQs for ENS Owners

### What does wrapping a domain mean?

When you wrap a domain, the domain is transferred to our contract. You are the only person who has any control over it. In return, you will receive an NFT representing the wrapped domain. You can list this for sale, transfer it etc just like any other NFT.

Once the domain is wrapped, you can configure various options such as whether others can mint subdomains of your domain, how much you would like to charge for subdomains, secondary royalties for secondary marketplaces, etc.

A wrapped domain can be withdrawn from the contract (only by the owner of the NFT representing it, of course) at a later date. If, however, you lock the domain then this prevents any withdrawals. A locked domain ensures to other users that any subdomain they mint is verifiably unruggable.

### Why would I wrap a domain?

There are many reasons and many possible uses. You may want to wrap your subdomain so that you can charge a fee to others to mint subdomains of your domain. You might do this because you have an attractive domain name for subdomain owners (for example, a surname domain, where people can register their forename as the subdomain, professions, short names etc), or you might have a domain name to base a community around.

You might want to use a subdomain of your domain as a feature within your Discord server. You can accomplish this with a recent update to Collabland whereby you can assign roles based not only the NFT's owned, but [specific attributes of those NFTs](https://collabland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/70000626238-command-center-features#article-body).

You might want to manage your own subdomain portfolio here, as we provide an intuitive interface to mint, setup, and redirect your subdomains.

### What options do I get when I wrap my domain?

When you wrap a domain, you can determine whether other people are able to purchase subdomains of your domain or not. If so, you can set a price they need to pay, you can set how much you expect in secondary royalties when subdomains are sold on secondary marketplaces. You can set a default image which will be used by default on the NFTs of all your subdomains. You can, at any time, decide to redirect your domain to point to another address. Finally, you can lock the domain, which will prevent it from being unwrapped from our contract whilst giving piece of mind to anyone looking to mint a subdomain.

### What does it mean for a domain to be locked / unlocked?

When a subdomain is locked, it means that it is impossible for anyone to ever unwrap that domain from the contract. The NFT representing it may be sold or transferred, things such as the price to mint subdomains may be altered, but it is a guarantee that no matter what, the domain will remain in our contract and your subdomain will be essentially unruggable.

### How do secondary royalties work?

You can set a secondary royalty percentage on your domain from anything between 0 and 10%.

Every time someone sells a subdomain of your domain through any secondary marketplace that supports on chain royalties\*, you will get a share of the sale equal to what you set as your secondary royalties.

\*Not all marketplaces currently support on chain royalties. Looksrare do support this whilst Opensea currently does not, but they recently announced plans to support it shortly.

### Do I still own my domain once I wrap it? What about once I lock it?

When you wrap your domain, the NFT for the ENS domain transfers into our contract, and our contract issues you with an NFT representing that domain.

The owner of the NFT you are issued has full access to perform any actions on the domain, such as setting subdomain minting prices or choosing to redirect where the domain points. If the domain remains unlocked, then you will also be able to unwrap it by turning in the NFT you were issued, and the domain will once again be yours, albeit without the suite of features supporting subdomains any longer.
