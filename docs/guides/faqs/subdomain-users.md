# FAQs for Subdomain Users

### How much does a subdomain cost?

The price to mint a subdomain is set by the owner of the domain. Each price is different, but you can head to the page for any specific domain and check the price on a domain you like yourself.

### What can I do with my subdomain?

A subdomain is just the same as a top level domain really. You can point it to any address you like, you can set your own address to reverse resolve to it (so that your wallet address appears as your subdomain on most dapps).

As it is an NFT, you can also transfer or sell it as you would any other NFT as well.

### When does my subdomain expire?

Technically, your subdomain will expire when the top level domain expires. There is no way to keep a subdomain active whilst the top level domain expires. However, renewing a domain is not only something the domain owner can do, but anyone can do it. This is why we have given the ability to extend a domain directly from its page, so that if you have a subdomain of a domain that is soon set to expire, you can extend it by as little or as much as you like. You will also benefit if someone else decides to extend for the same reason.
