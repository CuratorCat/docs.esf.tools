I'm a full stack developer with over a decade of software design / development experience. I've been a full time web3 developer for the last 12 months. Last year I wrote a custom resolver contract to manage .pcc.eth sub-domains which now has over 700 subdomains registered. I wrote Ethereum Subdomain Factory contracts to make managing sub-domains easier and add missing features.

I've been a developer for the past 6 years, creating primarily custom in-house tools either for myself or for a small private group of clients. I started off in desktop automation suites and have moved over to web technologies, spending the past 12 months working in Web3 on various tools / projects. Most of my projects have been for private use, but include an artblocks mint tool at the height of its popularity.
